# relslash
Proof of concept for updating multiple release branches of a tile

Need a new name (suggestions welcome). I thought since most backported branch names in the tile repos start with "rel/", that was the first thing that came to my name when creating the repo.

I am feeling the best place for most of this code is to be integrated into the https://github.com/pivotal-cf/kiln repo.
